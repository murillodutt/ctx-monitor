# Project Governance

This document defines the governance model for **ctx-monitor** development.

## Decision Model
The project uses a **Demand-Based Prioritization** model, balanced with the technical vision of the maintainers at **Dutt Yeshua Technology Ltd**.

### 1. Demand Collection
- **Voting**: Users can vote on features using reactions (+1) on Issues or by participating in Discussions.
- **Technical Necessity**: Certain structural improvements (refactoring, security) may be prioritized regardless of votes.

### 2. Prioritization Cycle
Monthly, maintainers review the most voted tasks and fit them into the technical roadmap, considering:
- Technical feasibility.
- Alignment with Claude Code architecture.
- Impact on system stability.

## Maintainers
- **Murillo Dutt** (@murillodutt) - BDFL / Lead Architect
- **Dutt Yeshua Team** - Core Reviewers and Maintainers

## External Contributions
We strongly encourage community participation. Significant contributions may lead to an invitation to become an official maintainer for specific modules.
